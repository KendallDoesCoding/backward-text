# backward-text
A website with a textbox where the user needs to enter some text, for eg: a name, fruits name or any text for that matter and when they tap the "Reverse" button the text reverses.

# Examples
- Apple to elppa
- Pear to raep
- Banana to ananab

# Why?
I needed a website to do this, instead of doing it manually for long words, and couldn't find anything like this so I made this.

# Project Website
I haven't hosted this project yet, but will do so shortly on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)

# Credit
- I didn't make this as of such, I got the code from [roseindia.net](https://www.roseindia.net/javascript/javascriptexamples/javascript-reverse-text-string.shtml), it was just a tutorial on how to do this, so I pasted it in and did my own styling etc so I haven't added a LICENSE to this repo (I added one but realized it was wrong cause I didn't write the code so removed it :)).
