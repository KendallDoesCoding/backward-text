# backward-text

A website with a textbox where the user needs to enter some text, for eg: a name, fruits name or any text for that matter and when they tap the "Reverse" button the text reverses.

# Examples

- **Apple** to **elppa**
- **Pear** to **raep**
- **Banana** to **ananab**
- **pseudopodia** to **aidopoduesp**

# Why?

I needed a website to do this, instead of doing it manually for long words, and couldn't find anything like this so I made this.

- I didn't make this as of such, I got the code from [roseindia.net](https://www.roseindia.net/javascript/javascriptexamples/javascript-reverse-text-string.shtml), it was just a tutorial on how to do this, so I pasted it in and did my own styling etc so I haven't added a LICENSE to this repo (I added one but realized it was wrong cause I didn't write the code so removed it :)).
